This session is beginner friendly with all materials provided. Just come with a willingness to engage in playful darkness, make things up and improvise a bit, and roll some dice. Content will be somewhat dark, but we can collectively set the tone somewhere between \"PG-13\" and \"R\", and will also be using \"safety tools\" to ensure comfort with subject matter. Note also that the Doom Room has low lighting, and that we will be playing atmospheric metal music (at a lowish volume) throughout the event.",

        "event_description": "Join us as we explore the deep, dark realms of Butoh, the avant-garde performance art form that originated in Japan in the wake of WWII, rising like a phoenix from the ashes of Hiroshima. Subverting conventional aesthetic notions by leaning into tension and dissonance, Butoh taps into the subconscious to unearth raw emotions and recover the primal body. In this workshop, we’ll peel back layers of socialization and unravel the guts of what it means to be human through embodied exploration and movement via guided imagery and introspective suggestions, bringing awareness and acceptance to the uncomfortable messes we’d much rather sweep under the rug. For those looking to slow the f**k down and deepen their somatic perceptivity, nervous system capacity, attention to detail, patience, curiosity, and sense of wonder; look no further! \r\n\r\nNo former experience with this practice is necessary, but arrive sober with your feels, an open mind, and a willingness to embrace the darkness and let it move you. Come dressed in clothing/footwear comfortable for movement on the beach, prepared to interact with the elements, as we will migrate to (and, optionally, into) the lake during the workshop. A towel, sunscreen, and hydration / a snack would also be advised. ",

After an opening discussion where we will address what to expect and consent, we'll go through a series of breathwork, light stretching and movement, identifying the erotic anatomy of the penis and the body, edging techniques, and conscious ejaculation. Our masturbation practice can be synchronous with how we show up and enjoy playtime with our partners. While this workshop will be helpful to all individuals bodied with a penis, the skills and techniques taught will also aid those who might experience premature ejaculation, delayed ejaculation, or delayed erections. To keep the container safe and accessible to all gender and sexual identities, this is strictly a solo self-pleasure workshop. After the workshop, we will close with a small group discussion where participants can share their experiences if they feel comfortable, or ask questions.\r\n",
